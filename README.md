# Zombies (game)

## About

That is simple project - made by me game, which can give you possibility to control your own character and shoot incoming zombies.

## Mechanics

Actually in-game mechanics are simple. You have cursor, and you must to point valid angle to hit enemies when you shot. Everytime when bullet hits an enemy he lose his HP. When enemy's HP is lower than 0 then he is dead. Also player character has his own HP. Actually one ony to die is to stay in collision with any zombie. While that is happening, you lost Hp every second till you will be dead. 

You have 5 life and you lose life when zombie reach left-border of map. So you can fail game only in case of dying or losing all 5 lifes.
